<ol>
<li>Open file settings.php in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor) and set these variables:
<table id="installation" summary="This is a simple two columns table - the first column names a variable and in second one has a descripton and the settings for the varible">

<tr class="odd">
<td nowrap="nowrap"><var>$settings['mboard_url']</var></td>
<td>URL to folder where message board is installed. Do NOT add a trailing &quot;/&quot; Examples:<br />

http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/ &nbsp; - <font color="#FF0000">Wrong</font>, dont add a / at the end!<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/mboard.php &nbsp; - <font color="#FF0000">Wrong</font>, don't add /mboard.php at the end!
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><span class="dest">Updated in 1.3</span><br /><var>$settings['autosubmit']</var></td>
<td>Setting this to <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> will require entering a &quot;security number&quot; in order to successfully
submit a new post or reply to the message board. I have added this to prevent SPAM.
Set to 0 if you want to disable the security number check.<br /><br />
<b>Setting to 1</b> will display the security number in a generated <b>image</b>. For this to work
your server must have GD library installed. You can test if your server supports all the required
functions by uploading the <b>gd_test.php</b> file to your server and open it in your browser.
If you get a red image with text WORKS your server shouldn't have problems with it. If you get an error (or blank page)
when opening gd_test.php try using the text version as explained below or ask your hosting company to install the GD library for PHP.<br /><br />
<b>Setting to 2</b> will display the security number in <b>text format</b>. While this is
not as effective as an image it will still block the majority of known spam robots.<br /><br />
RECOMMENDED SETTING: <var>$settings['autosubmit']=1</var>;<br />
OR if the above doesn't work try<br />
RECOMMENDED SETTING: <var>$settings['autosubmit']=2</var>;</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td nowrap="nowrap"><var>$settings['filter_sum']</var></td>
<td>This variable is used in the preventing automated
submissions and is just a little trick that should make it all even more reliable. The idea is to set this
to some random sequence of chars and numbers, for example <b>dhjx72js</b>. It doesn't really matter how long it is,
but you should use only chars (a-zA-Z) and digits (0-9). Don't leave the default value
(as it would loose the whole point), set it to something of your own. Examples would be
g3oyf98, p9ak85i, h398dgf and similar. Again, DO NOT USE these examples, just type some chars of your own!</td>

<td>Version 1.3 introduces new mechanism for fighting spam called <b>JunkMark<sup>TM</sup></b>,
developed by Klemen Stirn (the author).
It is designed to catch spammers who actually visit your MBoard and get past
the security number check. Setting this variable to 1 will enable
JunkMark<sup>TM</sup>, setting it to 0 will disable it. JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> calculates
probability of a message being SPAM and gives it a score between
0 (not SPAM) and 100 (SPAM). The higher the score the more likely the message is
SPAM<br /><br />

a JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> score same or higher to this limit will not be
allowed to post. Possible values are between 0 and 100. I don't recommend
setting it below 50! The optimal value is around 60 to 70.<br /><br />

</table>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save and close the settings.php file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public directory on your server (where the rest of your website is; usually "public_html", "www" or "site") and create a folder where you will install MBoard.<br />
Example: /public_html/mboard
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload all MBoard files to this folder. The "images" folder (all files in this folder) must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the MBoard directory create a folder called &quot;msg&quot;. It must be named
EXACTLY &quot;msg&quot;, CaSe SeNSiTiVE! Names like &quot;Msg&quot; or &quot;MSG&quot;
will result in an error! Make sure this folder is world-writable - on UNIX (Linux)
servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) this
folder to 777 (rwx-rwx-rwx). Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/msg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the PHP scripts have permission to write to files threads.txt
and counts.txt - on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) these two
files to 666 (rw-rw-rw).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have done all this your message board should work now. In your browser open
your MBoard, for example:<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/mboard.php and test it. You can delete messages
by clicking the red [X] icon and entering your admin password.</p>

<p>You may edit header.txt and footer.txt files to add your own header and footer
to the links page. You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example
instead of &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt; use
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt;! Same
goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the
header or footer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrading from version 1.2, 1.21 or 1.22</h3>

<p>To upgrade from version 1.2x to version 1.3 follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>BACKUP your old MBoard</li>
  <li>Edit the new settings.php file (more info under &quot;Installation&quot;) as new variables has been added</li>
  <li>Upload these files to your server in ASCII mode: javascript.js, mboard.php, print_sec_img.php, secimg.inc.php, settings.php </li>
  <li>Test everything. All your current posts should stay intact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<h2 id="help">&raquo; Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><span class="dest">PLEASE READ BEFORE ASKING</span> Since this script is free no support is guaranteed. You will find solutions for some common
problems below. If you can't get the script to work please go through this readme file again carefully and repeat the
installation step-by-step (also delete old files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to FIRST SEARCH for solutions
and then post any questions or problems you might have to <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>

<h3>1. What is CHMOD and FTP?</h3>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<h3>2. My message board doesn't work, HELP!</h3>

<p>Here are a few things to check:</p>
<ol>
  <li>did you upload the images folder in BINARY mode and all other files ASCII mode?</li>
  <li>did you create the &quot;msg&quot; folder? Remember the name is CaSe SeNSiTiVE!
   Did you CHMOD it to 777 (rwx-rwx-rwx)? You should be able to open this folder for example
   by typing http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/msg in your browser.</li>
  <li>are threads.txt and count.txt files world writable? CHMOD them to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a Linux server</li>
  <li>if images don't display correctly check if you uploaded them (the entire &quot;images&quot; folder) correctly. The images folder must be placed within the mboard folder, for example http://www.yourdomain.com/mboard/images</li>
  <li>go through the entire setup process again carefully</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. The security number image/text doesn't work (show up)?</h3>
<p>For the image to work your server must have GD library installed. You can test if your server supports all the required
functions by uploading the <b>gd_test.php</b> file to your server and open it in your browser. If you get an error (or an empty page)
when opening gd_test.php you should either ask your hosting company to install the GD library for PHP or
try with $settings['autosubmit'] set to 2. This will display the security number in text format
which is not as effective but better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you get the red WORKS image when opening gd_test.php but the security image still doesn't work you probably
have problems with sessions. Ask your hosting company to check PHP sessions configuration.
Same thing if $settings['autosubmit'] set to 2 doesn't work.</p>

<h3>4. I installed MBoard but I still get many SPAM messages?</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the latest version of MBoard and that you have variables <b>$settings['autosubmit']</b> set to 1 or 2 and <b>$settings['junkmark_use']</b> set to 1. Also make sure the variable <b>$settings['junkmark_limit']</b> is not set too high or too low (recommended value is 60).</p>

<h3>5. May I use JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> SPAM filter in my other scripts?</h3>
<p>No, you are not allowed to use JunkMark<sup>TM</sup> SPAM filter in any other script (commercial or open source) without my express written permission. It may only be used in MBoard and scripts that are direct derivates of MBoard (customized/modified versions).</p>

<h2 id="translate">&raquo; Adding / Translating bad words list</h2>

<p>As of version 1.1 MBoard can search for bad words in the comments and replace them with ****. Files with bad words list are stored in folder "badwords" and have two letter names. For now only English version is available (named "en.php").</p>
<p><b>Before adding new words please install MBoard and test it so you are sure it works properly!</b></p>
<p>To add new bad words open the en.php file in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor), find the comment saying INSERT NEW BAD WORDS BELOW THIS LINE and add new bad words in this format:<br />
  <br />
"BADWORD" =&gt; "REPLACEMENT",<br />
  <br />
  For example if "asfhkjhfasf" is a bad word you would add this line to the file:<br />
  <br />
"asfhkjhfasf" =&gt; "a**********",<br />
  <br />
  Don't forget to add a comma ( , ) after the line!</p>
<p>If you are translating the bad words file I suggest you leave the English words and add new ones in your language as explained above. Then save the file as two letter country code php file. For example, if you are translating the file in French, you should save the file as <b>fr.php</b> (CaSe SeNSiTiVe!). Upload fr.php to your "badwords" folder, go to settings.php again and set <b>$settings['filter_lang']</b> to <b>"fr"</b> (file name without .php).</p>
<p>Now test the MBoard again. If you get an Error or Warning when you try to post a new message this means something is wrong with your language file. It either can't be found (check the name of the file, on most servers names are CaSe SeNsiTiVe!) or something is wrong with PHP syntax in it (make sure all the words are added in<br />
  <b>"BADWORD" =&gt; "REPLACEMENT",</b> syntax).</p>
<p><b>Please send me the translated file</b>. If you translate the bad words file to your language please send it to info AT phpjunkyard DOT com (or contact me through PHPJunkard.com contact form) and I will make it available to others for download. You may include your name, website URL and e-mail address and I will give you proper credit (translated by John Doe. Visit www.yourwebsite.com).</p>
