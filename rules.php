	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	<p>Any player taking advantage of any of these Local Rules must consult with and gain agreement from his playing partners prior to proceeding with play.

	<li>The applicable USGA Handicap Rules state that appropriate tee differentials
	should be applied when players play in the same contest from different tees.(USGA Handicap Section 9:C:i) Such play shall be conducted in accordance with the rules as set forth in the USGA Handicap Manual; Section 9:C:i.</li>
	<li>When courses other than Chapel Ridge are played the USGA Handicap Rules would also apply taking into account Course Ratings of different tees.</li>
	<li>To be included in play on a given day, the member must be present 15 minutes before the first teetime to allow for team formation, etc.</li>

</ul>

In the event that a disputed action is not resolved by the participants on the spot the appropriate procedure of the USGA rules shall be followed and the matter referred to the representative USGA PRO at the completion of play for resolution and the determination of the day’s competition. If a player accepts the imposition of a rules violation and continues play in accord with the USGA procedure no further action will be enacted.

<h2>WAGERING</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The daily group wager shall be $5 per man; an optional skins pool bet of $3 may be wagered when skins are played during individual play</li>
	<li>Individual wagers within foursomes may be negotiated before play commences</li>
	<li>The nature of the daily wager shall be the responsibility of the Golf Czar.</li>
	<li>Different forms of competition may incorporate handicap adjustments in accordance with USGA Recommendations (see chart)</li>
	<li>Once play has commenced, the daily wager must be paid by the member regardless of whether the member finishes the round; unless due to illness or injury to the member</li>
	<li>Team stroke play events may be formed when equal number of players are available for play (2-,3-, and 4-man teams)</li>
	<li>Individual stroke play events will be formed when there are an uneven number of players (e.g. 5,7,11,13,17,19,23)</li>
	<li>Skins play shall use 50% of handicap with NO strokes on par three’s. Handicaps shall be rounded down to an even number (e.g. if a player’s handicap is 7 that player shall get three shots total in the skins game and 7 shots total in the low net competition).</li>
	<li>Two-man match play or partner match play events may be formed when there are an even number of players (e.g. 4, 10, 14, 18)</li>
	<li>Group selection in <strong>team play</strong> may be ABCD to encourage fairness of team makeup and to speed play.</li>
	<li>Group selection in <strong>individual play</strong> may group players of similar playing abilities and handicaps.</li>
	<li>Group and player selection in <strong>match play</strong> may be through random ball toss; the intent for two-man match play is that everyone play a match against every other player by year’s end so it may end up being less than random at some point.</li>
	<li><strong>Blind Draws will not be allowed in competition in 2016; however, the averaging of net scores may be used for team games when odd number of players are present AND there is a consensus to play a team game over an individual game.</strong></li>
	<li>Payouts for all wagers will be made in accordance with the Payout and Points Chart, with the exception of the skins pool which will be a separate betting pool and which bet shall be optional. Players must opt-in prior to the commencement of play on any given day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MATCH PLAY COMPETITION</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A year-ending true Double-Elimination Match Play tournament will be held at the end of the season. The tournament will be seeded based on a blind draw. Any player that has played during the regular season will be eligible to participate in the Match Play Tournament. A player’s handicap for the Match Play tournament will be the handicap as of the first day that the match is scheduled.</li>
	<li>The <strong>First Place Winner of the Match Play Championship</strong> shall receive temporary custody of the IFAD Champion’s Trophy, which rotates on an annual basis.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Top Finishers for the Match Play Championship</strong> shall have their names enshrined on the IFAD Group’s Annual Award Plaque, currently on display in the Chapel Ridge Clubhouse.</li>
